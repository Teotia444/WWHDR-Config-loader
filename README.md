While waiting for a better alternative i decided to quickly throw together an app to transfer the config.yaml file from the wii u to your pc and vice versa. 
You need to have specifically the ftpiiu plugin for aroma working. You need to have the app you want to transfer towards to be closed (i.e. if you want to transfer to your pc, close the pc app before running the tool)
